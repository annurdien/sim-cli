## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Best Practices

### Delete Command

The `delete` command is destructive and **permanently removes** the simulator or emulator.

- Always double-check the device name or UDID with `sim list` before deleting.
- Running devices are automatically stopped before deletion.
- Deleted devices must be recreated through Xcode (for iOS) or the AVD Manager (for Android).
